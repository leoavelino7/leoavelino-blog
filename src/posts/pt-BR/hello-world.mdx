## Introdution

`useEffect` and `useLayoutEffect` are React hooks that allow for the creation of side effects.
They are a replacement for the `componentDidMount`, `componentDidUpdate` and `componentWillUnmount` lifecycle methods on class components.

Kent C. Dodds has put together a [great guide](https://medium.com/@alexandereardon/uselayouteffect-and-ssr-192986cdcf7a) on when to use useEffect and when to use `useLayoutEffect`.
_TLDR_: most of the time you will want `_**useEffect**_`

`useLayoutEffect` is put forward as the safest upgrade path for class components

> `useLayoutEffectfires` in the same phase as `componentDidMount` and `componentDidUpdate` — [React Documentation](#)

However, if you use useLayoutEffect then you will get a nasty SSR console warning

```jsx
function App() {
  useLayoutEffect(() => {
    console.log("layout effect");
  });
  return "hello world";
}
// Will log a warning
const html = ReactDOMServer.renderToString(<App />);
```

> ⚠️ Warning: useLayoutEffect does nothing on the server, because its effect cannot
> be encoded into the server renderer’s output format. This will lead to a mismatch
> between the initial, non-hydrated UI and the intended UI. To avoid this,
> useLayoutEffect should only be used in components that render exclusively on the client.

Even though `useLayoutEffect` does nothing when using renderToString it will log a big old good time warning. Personally,
I am not a fan of this behaviour given that `useLayoutEffect` is the safest upgrade path for class components. However,
I can see the argument that for most people they should be using useEffect and this pushes them in that direction.
But I still think logging a warning is too much.

## A workaround (hack)

Create useIsomorphicLayoutEffect

```jsx
// use-isomorphic-layout-effect.js
import { useLayoutEffect, useEffect } from "react";
const useIsomorphicLayoutEffect =
  typeof window !== "undefined" ? useLayoutEffect : useEffect;
export default useIsomorphicLayoutEffect;
```
