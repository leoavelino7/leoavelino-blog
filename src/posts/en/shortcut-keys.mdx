## Introduction

In today's world, where speed and productivity are essential, every saved second matters. For those who frequently use web systems, optimizing their interactions can be the key to a more agile and effective workflow.

With this in mind, I have developed a library to facilitate the implementation of shortcuts in web systems. This can provide developers with the benefit of quickly implementing functionality in their systems and users with time savings in their routine tasks.

## About the library

Shortcut Keys was developed to make integration into systems simple, abstracting the process of registering, viewing, and removing shortcuts.

## Thinking about the development experience

If you were not using the library and intended to build everything from scratch, you would have to consider some points such as:

- What is my user's operating system?
- What happens if the shortcut I want to use already exists in the browser?

With Shortcut Keys, we handle this for you, so you only need to care about: What is my shortcut, and what should it do when triggered.


## Functions
<br />
- `add(shortcut, handler, options)` - To add a shortcut and the action it will trigger.
- `list()` - To list all existing shortcuts.
- `remove(shortcut)` - To remove an existing shortcut.
- `removeAll()` - To remove all existing shortcuts.

Just like the library, this is a straightforward post, and if you are interested in using it, you can find some examples in simple applications of HTML 5, ReactJS, Remix, and NextJS in the [Shortcut Keys documentation](https://shortcut-keys.vercel.app/).

If you have any questions or suggestions, your feedback would make me happy. And if you want to contribute, feel free to contribute directly to the project's code on [GitHub - Shortcut Keys](https://github.com/leoavelino7/shortcut-keys).
