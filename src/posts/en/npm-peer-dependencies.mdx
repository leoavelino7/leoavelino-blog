## Introduction

Looking at **package.json** many times I wondered what was the difference between **dependencies**, **devDependencies**, **peerDependencies**,
**peerDependenciesMeta** and **optionalDependencies**.

The purpose of this post is to help you understand what **peerDependencies** are for.

If you are also interested in understanding **optionalDependencies**, just access
[NPM - Optional dependencies](/pt-BR/post/npm-optional-dependencies).

## A summary about package.json

The **package.json** file is a manifest for Node.js projects. It contains information about the project (name, version, authors, dependencies,
license, scripts, among other information). To create it in a project, just run `npm init`.

In this file we have some definitions that are related to project dependencies. A summary of each of them:

- **dependencies:** Dependencies needed for the project to work in a production environment;
- **devDependencies:** Dependencies needed for the project to work in a development environment;
- **peerDependencies:** Required dependencies that the project user must install to use other dependencies;
- **peerDependenciesMeta:** Additional information about peerDependencies;
- **optionalDependencies:** Dependencies that can be installed or not. The lack of them does not compromise the correct functioning of the project.

## PeerDependencies

Peer dependencies changes a bit how we see the need to have external packages in our code. When we are developing a project that _won't_ be "Plug and
Play", it doesn't make sense to use peer dependencies. I say this because our project will have no other responsibilities besides compiling and
running in production, since it is our final code.

Now when we talk about libraries that will be shared, setting up some dependencies like this will be extremely useful. They will give our users the
freedom to install the version they want and thus be able to share the same dependency installed between different libraries.

For example, imagine you are developing 2 different component libraries for React applications. The A1 library will export the Button component. The
A2 library will export the Input component. In both libraries you will need to install the `react` and `react-dom` packages.

**Problem**

If for the A1 library the React versions are `16.10.0` and for the A3 `16.11.0`, this can lead to version conflicts when the user uses both in his
project. To avoid this problem, we can define these versions as **peerDependencies**, so the user of the library can have control over the react
version that will be used.

Another point to consider is that to use any of these libraries, the user would already need to have React in his project, so leaving this version
control with him makes total sense.

To help to understand, let's create 3 very simple libraries and a test application.

> For these examples I am using npm - 9.6.1 e node - 16.17.0

### Creating our libraries

Our libraries will be responsible for returning the difference from one list to the other and displaying in the terminal the version we are using
inside and outside the library for the same package.

1. Create a new folder and a `package.json` file.

   ```bash
   # It will create a folder calling my-lib
   mkdir my-lib &&
   # Go into the created folder
   cd my-lib &&
   # It will create the `package.json` file
   npm init -y
   ```

2. Change the `package.json` to:

   ```json
   {
     "name": "my-lib",
     "version": "1.0.0",
     "scripts": {
       "pack": "npm pack"
     },
     "peerDependencies": {
       "lodash": "^4.17.0"
     }
   }
   ```

   **npm pack** - Will package our library generating a **.tgz** file

3. Create a `index.js` file

   ```js
   const _ = require("lodash");

   const difference = (logMessage, arr1, arr2) => {
     const diff = _.difference(arr1, arr2);

     console.log(logMessage, "- lodash version:", _.VERSION);

     return diff;
   };

   module.exports = difference;
   ```

4. Install dependencies and package the library

   ```bash
   # Open the terminal in the `my-lib` project folder
   # And install the dependencies
   npm install &&
   # Will run our `pack` script that will pack our library
   # generating the `my-lib-1.0.0.tgz` file
   npm run pack
   ```

5. If everything went well, your folder structure should look like this:

   ```bash
     # |-- my-lib/
   # |------ index.js
   # |------ my-lib-1.0.0.tgz
   # |------ package-lock.json
   # |------ package.json
   ```

   ##### Break for explanation

   - As in step 2 we placed **lodash** as **peerDependencies**, note that when installing the dependencies (step 4) **it did not create a
     node_modules**. This, because the act of defining the dependency like this, makes it necessary for whoever uses it to install it.
   - As we put **^4.17.0**, it means that the minimum version of **lodash** needed for **my-lib** to work as expected is version **4.17.0**.

6. Create **my-lib-2**

   Let's duplicate the **my-lib** project.

   > If you prefer, you can use copy and paste. `CTRL + C` `CTRL + V`

   ```bash
   # Open a new terminal
   # Create my-lib-2 folder
   mkdir my-lib-2 &&
   # To copy `my-lib/index.js` and `my-lib/package.json` to `my-lib-2`
   cp my-lib/index.js my-lib-2/index.js &&
   cp my-lib/package.json my-lib-2/package.json &&
   cd my-lib-2
   ```

7. Change the `package.json` to:

   ```json
   {
     "name": "my-lib-2",
     "version": "1.0.0",
     "scripts": {
       "pack": "npm pack"
     },
     "dependencies": {
       "lodash": "^4.17.0"
     }
   }
   ```

8. Install dependencies and package the library

   ```bash
   # Open the terminal in the `my-lib-2` project folder
   # And install the dependencies
   npm install &&
   # Will run our `pack` script that will pack our library
   # generating the `my-lib-2-1.0.0.tgz` file
   npm run pack
   ```

9. If everything went well, you folder structure should look like this:

   ```bash
   # |-- my-lib/
   # |------ index.js
   # |------ my-lib-1.0.0.tgz
   # |------ package-lock.json
   # |------ package.json

   # |-- my-lib-2/
   # |------ node_modules/
   # |------------ lodash/
   # |------ index.js
   # |------ my-lib-2-1.0.0.tgz
   # |------ package-lock.json
   # |------ package.json
   ```

   ##### Break for explanation

   - As in our **my-lib-2** we defined **lodash** as **dependencies**, it is not necessary for the user to install **lodash**. As our library will do
     this automatically, this is why we have the **node_modules** folder.
   - As we put **^4.17.0**, it means that the minimum version of **lodash** needed for **my-lib-2** to work as we expect is version **4.17.0**.

10. Create **my-lib-3**

    Let's duplicate the **my-lib** project.

    > If you prefer, you can use copy and paste. `CTRL + C` `CTRL + V`

    ```bash
      # Open a new terminal
    # Create my-lib-3 folder
    mkdir my-lib-3 &&
    # To copy `my-lib/index.js` and `my-lib/package.json` to `my-lib-3`
    cp my-lib/index.js my-lib-3/index.js &&
    cp my-lib/package.json my-lib-3/package.json &&
    cd my-lib-3
    ```

11. Change the `package.json` to:
    ```json
    {
      "name": "my-lib-3",
      "version": "1.0.0",
      "scripts": {
        "pack": "npm pack"
      },
      "dependencies": {
        "lodash": "4.17.0"
      }
    }
    ```
12. Install dependencies and package the library

    ```bash
    # Open the terminal in the `my-lib-3` project folder
    # And install the dependencies
    npm install &&
    # Will run our `pack` script that will pack our library
    # generating the `my-lib-3-1.0.0.tgz` file
    npm run pack
    ```

13. If everything went well, you folder structure should look like this:

    ```bash
    # |-- my-lib/
    # |------ index.js
    # |------ my-lib-1.0.0.tgz
    # |------ package-lock.json
    # |------ package.json

    # |-- my-lib-2/
    # |------ node_modules/
    # |------------ lodash/
    # |------ index.js
    # |------ my-lib-2-1.0.0.tgz
    # |------ package-lock.json
    # |------ package.json

    # |-- my-lib-3/
    # |------ node_modules/
    # |------------ lodash/
    # |------ index.js
    # |------ my-lib-3-1.0.0.tgz
    # |------ package-lock.json
    # |------ package.json

    ```

    ##### Break for explanation

    - As in our **my-lib-3** we define **lodash** as **dependencies**, it is not necessary for the user to install **lodash**. As our library will do
      this automatically, this is why we have the **node_modules** folder.
    - As we put **4.17.0** and not **^4.17.0**, it means that the version of **lodash** needed for **my-lib-3** to work is version **4.17.0**. {" "}

> Probably you must be thinking that the only difference between **my-lib**, **my-lib-2** and **my-lib-3** is the fact of forcing or not the user to
> install a extra library when using them. If this is your thought, stay calm and let's go to the grand finale.

14. Creating application to test our library

    ```bash
    # Open a new terminal
    # Create my-app project folder
    mkdir my-app &&
    cd my-app &&
    npm init -y
    ```

15. Change the `package.json` to:

    ```json
    {
      "name": "my-app",
      "version": "1.0.0",
      "scripts": {
        "test": "node index.js"
      },
      "dependencies": {
        "lodash": "^4.17.21",
        "my-lib": "file:../my-lib/my-lib-1.0.0.tgz",
        "my-lib-2": "file:../my-lib-2/my-lib-2-1.0.0.tgz",
        "my-lib-3": "file:../my-lib-3/my-lib-3-1.0.0.tgz"
      }
    }
    ```

16. Create a `index.js` file

    ```js
    const _ = require("lodash");
    const myLib = require("my-lib");
    const myLib2 = require("my-lib-2");
    const myLib3 = require("my-lib-3");

    const arr1 = [1, 2, 3, 4];
    const arr2 = [1, 2, 4];

    myLib("my-lib", arr1, arr2);
    myLib2("my-lib-2", arr1, arr2);
    myLib3("my-lib-3", arr1, arr2);

    console.log("my-app lodash version:", _.VERSION);
    ```

17. Install dependencies

    ```bash
    # Open the terminal in the `my-app` project folder
    ## And install dependencies
    npm install
    ```

18. If everything went well, you folder structure should look like this:

    ```bash
      # |-- my-lib/
    # |------ index.js
    # |------ my-lib-1.0.0.tgz
    # |------ package-lock.json
    # |------ package.json

    # |-- my-lib-2/
    # |------ node_modules/
    # |------------ lodash/
    # |------ index.js
    # |------ my-lib-2-1.0.0.tgz
    # |------ package-lock.json
    # |------ package.json

    # |-- my-lib-3/
    # |------ node_modules/
    # |------------ lodash/
    # |------ index.js
    # |------ my-lib-3-1.0.0.tgz
    # |------ package-lock.json
    # |------ package.json

    # |-- my-app/
    # |------ node_modules/
    # |------------ lodash/
    # |------------ my-lib/
    # |------------ my-lib-2/
    # |------------ my-lib-3/
    # |------------ package-lock.json
    # |------ index.js
    # |------ package-lock.json
    # |------ package.json
    ```

19. Finally, run **npm test** The result in the terminal will be:

    ```bash
        > my-app@1.0.0 test
    > node index.js

    my-lib - lodash version: 4.17.21
    my-lib-2 - lodash version: 4.17.21
    my-lib-3 - lodash version: 4.17.0
    my-app lodash version: 4.17.21
    ```

### Explanation

In all our libraries, we put a **console.log** in **index.js** to display the version of lodash that was running.

Our **my-lib** library log indicates lodash version 4.17.21. That's because in it, the lodash is as peerDependencies and with a minimum version rule.
So we are obliged to have **lodash** installed in our **my-app**.

> Reread **Break for explanation** in step 5.

Our library log **my-lib-2** indicates lodash version 4.17.21. That's because in it, lodash is as dependencies with a minimum version of 4.17.0. As we
installed a version greater than 4.17.0 in **my-app** and it is within the rules of **my-lib-2**, it is used for both.

> Reread **Break for explanation** in step 9.

Our library log **my-lib-3** indicates lodash version 4.17.0. That's because in it, lodash is as dependencies with fixed version in 4.17.0. As we
installed a different version in **my-app**, it cannot reuse, so two different versions of lodash are installed. One for **my-lib-3** and one for
**my-app**.

> Reread **Break for explanation** in step 13.

And our last log indicates which version of lodash was installed in **my-app**.

### Uninstalling and causing error

We understand that because of **my-lib** we are required to have lodash installed in **my-app**, so let's uninstall it and see what happens.

1. **my-app** lodash uninstall

   ```bash
     # Open the terminal in my-app
     npm uninstall lodash
   ```

2. Running test

   ```bash
   npm test
   ```

3. Why didn't it fail ?

   Because **my-lib-2** and **my-lib-3** dependencies have lodash as **dependency**. When installing them in our project, lodash is also installed.
   Then **my-lib** can access it.

4. Uninstalling **my-lib-2** and **my-lib-3**

   Let's make two changes, one to `index.js`:

   ```js
   const _ = require("lodash");
   const mylib = require("my-lib");
   // const mylib2 = require("my-lib-2");
   // const mylib3 = require("my-lib-3");

   const arr1 = [1, 2, 3, 4];
   const arr2 = [1, 2, 4];

   mylib("my-lib", arr1, arr2);
   // mylib2("my-lib-2", arr1, arr2);
   // mylib3("my-lib-3", arr1, arr2);

   console.log("my-app lodash version:", _.VERSION);
   ```

   And in the `package.json`:

   ```json
   {
     "name": "my-app",
     "version": "1.0.0",
     "scripts": {
       "test": "node index.js"
     },
     "dependencies": {
       "my-lib": "file:../my-lib/my-lib-1.0.0.tgz"
     }
   }
   ```

   Now let's install the dependencies again and run our test.

   ```bash
   npm install && npm test
   ```

   💣 BOOOM. Now yes, it gave error:

   ```bash
   # Error: Cannot find module 'lodash'
   # Require stack: ....
   ```

   This happened because it was just our dependency that needs lodash and that lodash is in it as **peerDependencies**.

5. And if we install a version lower than the one defined in peerDependencies ?

   If you remember, we defined a minimum version required to guarantee the working of lodash in our **my-lib** library. What will happen if we install
   a version older than the defined minimum? 🤔

   ```bash
    npm install lodash@3 && npm test
   ```

   😯 Whoa! Our code ran successfully.

   > So we must always be careful with the packages we use and good test coverage to avoid an incorrect version change, not realizing the big problem
   > that this can cause.

   Now let's keep this version of lodash and go back with our other libraries and see what happens.

6. Coming back with **my-lib-2** and **my-lib-3**

Let's make two changes, one to `index.js`:

```js
const _ = require("lodash");
const mylib = require("my-lib");
const mylib2 = require("my-lib-2");
const mylib3 = require("my-lib-3");

const arr1 = [1, 2, 3, 4];
const arr2 = [1, 2, 4];

mylib("my-lib", arr1, arr2);
mylib2("my-lib-2", arr1, arr2);
mylib3("my-lib-3", arr1, arr2);

console.log("my-app lodash version:", _.VERSION);
```

And in `package.json`:

```json
{
  "name": "my-app",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "scripts": {
    "test": "node index.js"
  },
  "dependencies": {
    "lodash": "^3.10.1",
    "my-lib": "file:../my-lib/my-lib-1.0.0.tgz",
    "my-lib-2": "file:../my-lib-2/my-lib-2-1.0.0.tgz",
    "my-lib-3": "file:../my-lib-3/my-lib-3-1.0.0.tgz"
  }
}
```

Now let's install the dependencies again and run our test.

```bash
npm install && npm test
```

🤯 Output:

```bash
     > my-app@1.0.0 test
 > node index.js

 my-lib - lodash version: 3.10.1
 my-lib-2 - lodash version: 4.17.21
 my-lib-3 - lodash version: 4.17.0
 my-app lodash version: 3.10.1
```

Did you expect this? 🤣🤣

- As **my-lib** is with **lodash** as **peerDependencies**, it considered the version we installed in **my-app**.
- As **my-lib-2** has **lodash** as **dependencies**, she didn't use the version we have in **my-app** and made sure by installing lodash in the version she needs.
- As **my-lib-3** is with **lodash** with a fixed version in **dependencies**, it didn't use the version we have in **my-app** and made sure by installing lodash in the version that she needs.

Well, I hope I helped you in some way.
